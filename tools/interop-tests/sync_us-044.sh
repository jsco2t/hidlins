# sync_us-044.sh — KeePassXC interop for the US-044 collision merge
# (s3-sync T6.3 / impl plan §8.4.4).
#
# The Rust suite proves the merge engine + orchestrator produce the right
# in-memory result (us_044_collision_merge.rs, MINIO-010). This script closes
# the NFR-009 loop: a *merged* Hidlins vault must round-trip through a
# standards-compliant KeePassXC, with the collision loser preserved as a
# history entry that KeePassXC can read.
#
# `merge-interop-driver` writes a merged vault whose one entry has current
# title "winner" and a history entry titled "loser". We export it to XML with
# keepassxc-cli (the export includes <History> entries) and assert both are
# present.
