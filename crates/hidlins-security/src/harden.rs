//! Process hardening (PMF-2 / FU-CORE-DUMP).
//!
//! Best-effort runtime mitigations applied **once at frontend startup, before
//! any vault is opened**. This module is the home for future process hardening
//! (e.g. `mlock` of the master key); today it suppresses core dumps.
//!
//! ## Audited `unsafe`
//!
//! The crate is `#![cfg_attr(not(test), deny(unsafe_code))]`. This module makes
//! one libc syscall (`setrlimit`) inside a single locally-`#[allow]`ed,
//! documented block — the same posture the crate reserves for `os_events::macos`
//! (and `hidlins-core` for its `mlock` block).

/// Apply best-effort process hardening. Call **once** at frontend startup,
/// before any vault is opened.
///
/// Today this suppresses core dumps by setting `RLIMIT_CORE` to zero: CLAUDE.md
/// (Security rules) requires it for the TUI/agent, because a core dump of the
/// live process can spill the unlocked vault and master key to disk.
///
/// Best-effort by design — a failure to set the limit cannot be meaningfully
/// recovered and must never abort startup, so the result is intentionally
/// ignored (there is no logging facility to route it to; project "no telemetry"
/// rule). On the Phase-0 targets (macOS, Linux) the syscall succeeds; the
/// `getrlimit`-readback unit test asserts the effect.
///
/// ## Honest limits (CLAUDE.md principle #5)
///
/// - Does **not** defend against a privileged attacker that re-raises the limit.
/// - `SIGKILL`, swap, and cold-boot / DMA attacks are out of scope.
/// - Not async-signal-safe; do not call from a signal handler.
/// - On non-Unix targets (never a Phase-0 ship target, but present in the
///   resolver's transitive triples) this is a no-op.
