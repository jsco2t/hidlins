//! Sensitive-buffer wrappers — [`MasterPassword`] and [`Keyfile`].
//!
//! Per design §2.2.2 and FR-050: every type in this module that holds
//! plaintext bytes implements `Zeroize + ZeroizeOnDrop`, and every type
//! suppresses `Debug` to prevent accidental logging via `dbg!`, panics,
//! or trace lines. Callers (typically the CLI/TUI) collect bytes from
//! the user (e.g., via `rpassword`) and wrap them in [`MasterPassword`]
//! before handing them to `hidlins-core` — the library never prompts.

/// `hidlins-core` does not own a TTY or prompt; that's the CLI/TUI's
/// job (design §3.4 — "vault-core takes a pre-collected `MasterPassword`
/// value").
///
/// On Unix the buffer is additionally `mlock(2)`ed while the value is
/// alive (best-effort — `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK` quotas are small, so a failed
/// lock is silently tolerated rather than treated as fatal; see
/// `kb/memory-hygiene.md`). The lock is released and the bytes zeroized
/// on drop. This covers the password itself; key material derived
/// inside `keepass-rs` (`DatabaseKey`, Argon2 output) is owned by that
/// crate and cannot be locked from here — an honest, documented limit.
///
/// Invariant the `mlock` relies on: the inner `String` is never mutated
/// after construction (no method takes `&mut self` except `zeroize`,
/// which overwrites in place without reallocating), so the heap buffer
/// address registered with `mlock` stays valid until `munlock` in drop.
