//! `SyncRuntime` — the background sync worker over `hidlins_sync::Sync` (T6.1 /
//! ADR-T4a).
//!
//! The worker **takes ownership of the moved vault** (and the registry) for the
//! duration of a sync: `App.vault.take()` → spawn → `sync_now(&mut vault, …)` →
//! hand both back on completion. While a sync is in flight `App.vault` is `None`,
//! so the UI stays responsive (ticks, lock countdown, cancel/quit) but the vault
//! content is briefly unavailable. There is no concurrent-edit race because the
//! App cannot edit a vault it does not hold.
//!
//! **Master-password handling (ADR-T4):** the `App` never retains a
//! `MasterPassword`. One is moved into [`SyncRuntime::start`] per sync and is
//! dropped (zeroized) on the worker thread the moment `sync_now` returns.
//!
//! **No cancellation hook:** `hidlins_sync`'s `sync_now` exposes only
//! `max_retries` + `on_activity` (no cancel). A lock that fires mid-sync is
//! therefore *deferred* by the App until the worker returns (the App marks
//! "lock pending"; on completion the vault is dropped+zeroized → `LockScreen`).
//!
//! **The engine seam:** there is no upstream `Sync` *trait* to mock — `Sync` is
//! a concrete struct and `hidlins_sync`'s `MemoryTransport` can't be injected
//! through the public `sync_now` (it builds the transport from registry config
//! internally). So this module declares a local [`SyncEngine`] trait exactly
//! like Phase 5's `ClipboardSink`: the real impl delegates to
//! `hidlins_sync::Sync::sync_now`; tests inject a fake to control timing and
//! outcomes.
