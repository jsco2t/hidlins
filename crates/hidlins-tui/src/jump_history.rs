//! Session-only jump history (T4.4, design §2.2.8 / D-8).
//!
//! A browser-style back/forward stack over visited nodes (entries *and*
//! groups). It is **session-only**: capped at [`JUMP_HISTORY_CAP`], never
//! persisted to `tui.toml`, and cleared on lock (like all other view state), so
//! it carries no zeroize obligations — it holds UUIDs, not secrets.
//!
//! The visited trail lives in `back`, most-recent last; the currently-shown
//! node is the trail head. [`JumpHistory::back`]/[`JumpHistory::forward`] take
//! the live selection as `current` so a selection moved by arrow keys (which do
//! not push) can never desync the walk.
