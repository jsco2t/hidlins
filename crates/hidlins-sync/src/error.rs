//! The crate's single public error type (design §2.5).
//!
//! Variants name the failure mode (auth, not-found, precondition, transport,
//! etc.) so callers can branch on them programmatically. No variant ever
//! carries plaintext passwords, decrypted vault contents, KDBX bytes, or any
//! credential material — the same discipline `hidlins-core::VaultError`
//! follows. The enum is `#[non_exhaustive]` so later phases can add variants
//! without a `SemVer` break.
