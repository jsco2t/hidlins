//! Two-way KDBX merge adapter (FR-043).
//!
//! # Why an adapter, not a hand-written engine
//!
//! `keepass-rs` ships a UUID-keyed, timestamp-ordered database merge
//! (`Database::merge`, gated behind its `_merge` feature, which
//! `hidlins-core` enables). It already implements the FR-043 reconciliation
//! we need — entry identity by UUID, newer-`last_modification` wins, and the
//! loser of a collision preserved as a KDBX history entry under the same UUID
//! — against the crate's real (flat, id-keyed) data model. Re-deriving that
//! against the same data structures is impossible from this crate: every
//! UUID-preserving insert API (`Group::add_entry_with_id`, `EntryId::from_uuid`)
//! is `pub(crate)`. So we wrap the upstream merge behind the single chokepoint
//! [`reconcile`] and pin its observable behaviour with a defensive
//! characterization suite (`tests/merge_semantics.rs`).
//!
//! This supersedes the original three-way design (ADR-005); see design
//! **ADR-008** and `kb/three-way-merge.md`.
//!
//! # No-data-loss guarantee
//!
//! [`reconcile`] folds `remote` into `local` in place. `Database::merge` alone
//! is asymmetric — it preserves the *destination*'s loser as history only when
//! that entry already carries history, and never preserves the *source*'s
//! losing current value. Because a silently dropped secret version is often
//! unrecoverable, [`reconcile`] adds a defensive backfill pass that enforces a
//! single invariant: **every pre-merge entry version, from either side, that is
//! not the merged current value survives as a history entry under the same
//! UUID.** Collisions are still resolved by newer `last_modification` (the
//! winner becomes current); the loser — whichever side it is, and regardless of
//! whether it carried prior history — is recovered into history. The backfill
//! is idempotent (a version already present is detected and not re-added, so
//! repeated syncs do not grow history).
//!
//! # Attachment handling
//!
//! Upstream `Database::merge` does not merge the attachment binary pool
//! (`merge.rs` has an explicit `TODO`). Two consequences are repaired here and
//! two are documented as limitations:
//!
//! - **Repaired: entries newly added from `remote`.** Upstream clones a
//!   source-only entry wholesale — including its attachment map, whose values
//!   are *remote-pool indices* — without copying the referenced bytes. Left
//!   alone, those references dangle (the attachment silently disappears on
//!   the next open) or, worse, alias an unrelated binary in the local pool
//!   (the entry shows the wrong attachment). [`reconcile`] runs a repair pass
//!   (`repair_added_entry_attachments`) that copies the referenced bytes
//!   from `remote`'s pool into `local`'s and re-points the references.
//! - **Repaired: attachment edits on entries present on both sides.** When
//!   `remote` wins a both-sides collision, upstream copies its fields but not
//!   its attachments (same pool-merge `TODO`), so an attachment added, replaced,
//!   or removed on the winning side would not reach the merged current value.
//!   [`reconcile`] runs `propagate_both_side_attachments`, which reconciles
//!   the merged entry's attachment set to the winner's (remote-wins only;
//!   compare-before-mutate; `last_modification` bumped on mutation so a re-sync
//!   is a no-op — REQUIRED because `have_entries_diverged` compares the
//!   attachment map by pool id). This is last-writer-wins at *entry*
//!   granularity: an attachment edit still loses if the other side has a newer
//!   *field* edit on the same entry.
//!
//! ## Remaining Phase-0 limitations (acceptable; tracked as follow-ups)
//!
//! - **Cross-device pool-id divergence can surface `Unresolvable`.** Because the
//!   repaired/added attachment gets a fresh local pool id, two devices whose
//!   pools assign the same logical attachment a different numeric id can meet at
//!   an equal timestamp that upstream's `have_entries_diverged` (which compares
//!   pool ids, not bytes) reads as diverged. There is no public API to force
//!   matching ids. This fails safe (`.kdbx.bak` preserved, no silent loss) and
//!   is strictly better than the pre-fix behaviour, which silently dropped the
//!   attachment. Removals converge cleanly (an empty map equals an empty map
//!   regardless of ids). Shared with `repair_added_entry_attachments`; folded
//!   into the `merge-history-attachment-loss` upstream follow-up (make keepass
//!   attachment handling merge-aware: content-based comparison / a real pool
//!   merge).
//! - **History entries do not capture attachment bytes.** Versions preserved
//!   into history (by upstream's history merge or our backfill) keep their
//!   field content, but their attachment references cannot be rewritten from
//!   this crate (`Entry::attachments` is `pub(crate)` upstream), so a
//!   remote-side historical version's attachment bytes are not carried into
//!   the local pool. The pre-merge state survives one generation in
//!   `.kdbx.bak`. (The backfill's content comparison also cannot inspect the
//!   attachment pool, so attachment-bearing entries may gain an extra history
//!   entry; this fails safe, i.e. it over-preserves, never drops.)
//! - **Same-second divergence is unresolvable.** Two devices editing the same
//!   entry within KDBX's one-second timestamp granularity, with differing
//!   content, cannot be auto-ordered — surfaced as [`MergeError::Unresolvable`]
//!   with the pre-merge `.kdbx.bak` preserved. Vanishingly rare for a single
//!   user; fails safe (no merge is written).
//!
//! Every behaviour above is asserted in the characterization suite
//! (`tests/merge_semantics.rs`) so a future `keepass-rs` bump that changes it
//! fails CI loudly.
